# ticTacToe

This tic tac toe game consists of a matrix that looks like this:
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
where the player can choose a number and the number will be replaced by their symbol (i.e. X or O)..
For example, if I choose 5 and my symbol is X the matrix will look like this:
    1 2 3
    4 X 6
    7 8 9
And same goes for if my partner chooses 9:
    1 2 3
    4 X 6
    7 8 O
and so on:
    1 2 3
    4 X X
    O 8 O
until someone wins:

    X X X
    O 8 O
